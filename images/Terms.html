                            <b>BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING DABSTER ENTERTAINMENT’S SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.</b>
                            </p><p>
                If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service, the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy, or any other Dabster Entertainment policy, rule or code of conduct relating to your use of the Service, you must immediately stop using the Service in which event your license to use the Service will immediately terminate.
                                </p><p>
                In some cases, a certain Service may require you to read and agree to specific terms and conditions.  Your right to use that Service is subject to those specific terms and these Terms of Service.  To the extent these Terms of Service or Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy conflict with any other Dabster Entertainment terms, policy, rules or codes of conduct, the terms contained in these Terms of Service and in the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy will govern.</p><p>
                You agree that you are (and if you are under the age of 13, your legal guardian is) fully able and competent to agree to, and comply with, these Terms of Service.</p><p>
                    
                    </p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                
                Use of the Service is also governed by Dabster Entertainment’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our Privacy Policy contains important information about how we collect and use your content and personal data and how you can use the Service to share such information with others. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.</p><p>
                
                    </p><h2>Updates to the Terms of Service and Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                Dabster Entertainment reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms on or within the Service or on our website. You may also be given additional notice, such as an e-mail message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective the day they are initially posted. No amendment to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of which Dabster Entertainment had actual notice before the date of the amendment.
                You understand that the Service is an evolving one. Dabster Entertainment may require that you accept updates to the Service and products that you have installed on your device. You acknowledge and agree that Dabster Entertainment may update the Service with or without notifying you.

                    <p>
                    </p><h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>
                Dabster Entertainment may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy without Dabster Entertainment’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void and ineffective.</p><p>
                
                    </p><h2>Supplemental Policies</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p><h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Service, any supplemental policies and any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein (including Dabster Entertainment’s Privacy Policy), contain the entire understanding of you and Dabster Entertainment, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and Us with respect to the Service.</p><p>
                    </p><h2>Governing Law</h2>
                    <p>
                
                Any claim relating to Dabster Entertainment’s web site shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                        </p><p>
                    </p><h2>Severability</h2>
                    <p>
                You and Dabster Entertainment agree that if any portion of these Terms of Service or of the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.
                        </p><p>
                    </p><h2>No Waiver</h2>
                    <p>
                        The failure of Dabster Entertainment to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Service or the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Dabster Entertainment’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.
                        </p><p>
                The express waiver by Dabster Entertainment of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the Dabster Entertainment Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
                            </p><p>
                Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by Dabster Entertainment shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Service nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Dabster Entertainment.
                                </p><p>
